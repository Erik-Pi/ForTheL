# ForTheL
A collection of formalizations in ForTheL to be checked by Naproche-SAD.

More details on the (original) linear algebra formalizations are found under
https://github.com/Felix-Thiele/linear_algebra_ftl.

To run the formalizations in Naproche-SAD, create a folder "representations" inside the "examples" folder and paste the FTL files there.
